    "Your Class should be able to create an Student object instance with the following properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct with default attributes for School Name, Student First Name, and Last Name\n",
    "- Methods to update any of these above attributes\n",
    "- An overloaded method for the str() function to return the Student attributes in a string formatted sentence \"{FirstName} {LastName} is a student of {SchoolName}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to implement this class however you like. The testing code is included below. Don't be afraid to check the [documentation]('https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html') or any other resources you would like! Internet searching is a big part of promgramming"

Class flexibility is designed so that your approach reflects your own personal understanding of the problem. But for a more structured challenge read on...\n",
