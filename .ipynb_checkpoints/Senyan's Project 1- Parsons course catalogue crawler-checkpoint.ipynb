    "## Why I made this\n",
    "For the first project, my learning goal is to practice crawling websites. \n",
    "Initially, I crawled Indeed.com for jobs and related information, but I hit a snag half way into the project when my bot failed CAPTCHA enforced by the website. After looking to Robots.txt on Indeed.com, I realized that it prohibits me crawling information in large quantity. \n",
    "\n",
    "I found it interesting that (almost) every site I visit has specific rules in regard to crawling. Parsons course catalogue is the first I encountered that allows all crawling behaviors. This is the primary reason why I pivoted from crawling indeed.com to Parson's course catalogue. Another reason is because I want to aggreagte course information in a way that conforms to my habit better:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I wish to get more accurate results when I search by instructor name. If I search for Sven Travis on the current website, it would return all courses taught by instructors whose full name contains either \"Sven\" or \"Travis\", instead of just whom I am looking for (The best Sven there is.) \n",
    "Second, I want to see more information on the instructor for every course. I would usually look into the intructor if I am interested in any class, it would be great if I can see this information at the same place as the course. Since ratemyprofessors.com is heavily biased and prohibits crawling, I looked for course evals on Parsons. My efforts were to no avail because such information was only available to faculty. Luckily, I discovered that every faculty has a page in Parson's faculty directory, and the URL follows the same pattern that can be uniquely identified by the instructor name. \n",
    "Third, I wish to shorten the distance to get CRN for every class. On the course website, crn is not shown until I click open a specific course. Since this information comes handy for registration, I want to see it right away. "

    "## Why selenium library\n",
    "One of the biggest challenge I encoutered was dealing with the static url on Parsons course catalogue. To filter the courses that I can choose from, I would need to click on the filters to reveal those courses. However, the URL remains the same. This makes crawling tricky because requests relies on the URL to get the web page. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, I found the Selenium library. It enabled me to emulate a robot that can perform clicking and scrolling actions like a human user on a website. This way, even though the url remains static, the page I am crawling will contain the right information. "
